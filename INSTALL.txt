Install CalemEAM
Installation guide is available at http://www.calemeam.com/support_setup.html if you
are installing CalemEAM the first time.

Upgrade from CalemEAM r1.0.1/r1.0.1ac/r1.0.1x to r1.0.2:
1. Unzip the archive file to the same directory of r1.0.1/r1.0.1ac/r1.0.1x
2. Merge the contents of CalemEAM/server/conf/custom.bat (or .sh) and install.bat (.sh)
   into one file and name this file calem.custom.bat (or .sh).
   These files are no longer needed in the CalemEAM/server/conf, move them to 
   another directory for future reference:
    install.php, custom.php, install.sample.php, custom.sample.php
3. Run setup.bat (setup.sh) to configure logging.
   Run deploy.bat (deploy.sh) to deploy r1.0.2 release.
4. Launch a browser to use r1.0.2.
