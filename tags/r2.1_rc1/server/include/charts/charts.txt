CalemEAM's Dashboard uses amCharts (http://www.amcharts.com/). 
You can download amCharts (amLine, amColumn and amPie) and place it under this directory.
The directory would look like this under this directory:
CalemEAM
  - server
     - include
        - charts
          - amcolumn (this is amColumn)
          - amline (this is amLine)
          - ampie (this is amPie)
          - share (this is the export.php file for print amCharts)
