<P>The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
Section <A HREF="#section-2.2">2.2</A>. The Source Code version of
Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License
or a future version of this License released under Section <A HREF="#section-6.1">6.1</A>,
and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the
Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on
any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However,
You may include an additional document offering the additional rights
described in Section <A HREF="#section-3.5">3.5</A>. 
</P>
<H3><A NAME="section-3.2"></A>3.2. Availability of Source Code.</H3>
<P>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must
be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve
(12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least
six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular
Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are
responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains
available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained
by a third party. 
</P>
<H3><A NAME="section-3.3"></A>3.3. Description of Modifications.</H3>
<P>You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain
a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code
and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement
that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from
Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the
name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any
notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You
describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

<H3><A NAME="section-3.4"></A>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</H3>
<H4><A NAME="section-3.4-a"></A>(a) Third Party Claims</H4>
<P>If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
granted by such Contributor under Sections <A HREF="#section-2.1">2.1</A>
or <A HREF="#section-2.2">2.2</A>, Contributor must include a text
file with the Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which
describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient
detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor
obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as
described in Section <A HREF="#section-3.2">3.2</A>, Contributor
shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes
available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has
been obtained.

<H4><A NAME="section-3.4-b"></A>(b) Contributor APIs</H4>
<P>If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are
reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also
include this information in the <STRONG>legal</STRONG> file. 
</P>
<H4><A NAME="section-3.4-c"></A>(c) Representations.</H4>
<P>Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to

believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original
creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the

<H3><A NAME="section-3.5"></A>3.5. Required Notices.</H3>
<P>You must duplicate the notice in <A HREF="#exhibit-a">Exhibit A</A>
in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such
notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then
You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If
You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a
Contributor to the notice described in <A HREF="#exhibit-a">Exhibit
A</A>. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for
the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
obligations of Section <A HREF="#section-3.2">3.2</A>. The notice
must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute
the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a
license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this
License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
License and that the license for the Executable version does not
attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code
version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute
the Executable version under a different license You must make it
absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are
offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 
</P>
<H3><A NAME="section-3.7"></A>3.7. Larger Works.</H3>

the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

<H2><A NAME="section-4"></A>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or
Regulation.</H2>
<P>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of
this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
must be included in the <STRONG>legal</STRONG> file described in
Section <A HREF="#section-3.4">3.4</A> and must be included with all
distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by
statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed
for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 
</P>
<H2><A NAME="section-5"></A>5. Application of this License.</H2>
<P>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has

that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the
terms of any subsequent version of the License published by CalemEAM.
No one other than CalemEAM has the right to modify the terms
applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

that the phrases &quot;CalemEAM&quot;, &quot;CPL&quot; or any
confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to
note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise
make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which
differ from the CalemEAM Public License. (Filling in the name of the
Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice
described in <A HREF="#exhibit-a">Exhibit A</A> shall not of
themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

of the covered code is with you. Should any covered code prove
defective in any respect, you (not the initial developer or any other

the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable
value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections <A HREF="#section-2.1">2.1</A>

limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
